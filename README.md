# ML Algorithms using GIS for Spatial Analysis – Delhi Region


## Abstract

The integration of Machine Learning (ML) techniques with Geographical Information Systems (GIS) enables advanced spatial analysis and predictive modeling. This project applies multiple supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms to geospatial datasets of the Delhi region to identify spatial patterns, perform classification, and generate predictive insights.

The study evaluates model performance using statistical metrics and compares algorithm effectiveness for spatial decision-making applications such as urban planning and environmental monitoring.
